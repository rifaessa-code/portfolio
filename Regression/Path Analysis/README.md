# Path Analysis — Factors Influencing Academic Procrastination with Time Management as an Intervening Variable

This project analyzes the factors influencing **Academic Procrastination (Y)** using **Path Analysis**, with **Time Management (Z)** as an intervening variable.  
The analysis was conducted using data from **211 college students**, and represents the final project completed during the D3 program.

## 🎯 Research Objective

To investigate how psychological factors such as **self-efficacy, burnout, self-esteem, and self-control** affect **academic procrastination**, both directly and indirectly through **time management**.

---

## 📊 Variables in the Study

### **Independent Variables (X)**  
- **Self-Efficacy (X1)**  
  - Belief in one's ability to successfully complete academic tasks.
- **Burnout (X2)**  
  - Emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced academic effectiveness.
- **Self-Esteem (X3)**  
  - Overall perception of personal worth and self-value.
- **Self-Control (X4)**  
  - Ability to regulate emotions, impulses, and behaviors.

### **Intervening Variable (Z)**  
- **Time Management (Z)**  
  - Ability to plan, use, and control time effectively for academic responsibilities.

### **Dependent Variable (Y)**  
- **Academic Procrastination (Y)**  
  - Tendency to delay or postpone academic tasks intentionally despite negative consequences.

## 🧪 Sample

- **Total Respondents:** 211 college students  
- Data collected using standardized questionnaires for each construct.

---

## 🛠️ Analysis Method

The analysis uses **Path Analysis**, which allows the examination of:

- **Direct effects**  
  (e.g., self-efficacy → academic procrastination)
- **Indirect effects via time management**  
  (e.g., self-control → time management → procrastination)
- **Total effects**  
  (sum of direct + indirect effects)

Path analysis evaluates both structural relationships among psychological variables and mediation effects.

## 🧰 Tools & Software

- **SPSS**
- Path diagram modeling tools  
- Statistical outputs: path coefficients, significance tests, model fit indices.

---

## 🔍 Analysis Stages

### **1. Data Cleaning & Scoring**
- Reverse scoring if needed  
- Summation or averaging of questionnaire items  
- Reliability testing for each construct (Cronbach's Alpha)

### **2. Validity & Reliability**
- **Validity:** item-total correlation  
- **Reliability:** Cronbach’s Alpha ≥ 0.70

### **3. Model Specification**
- Define structural relationships between X → Z → Y  
- Build a path diagram

### **4. Path Analysis**
Includes:
- **Direct Effect Testing**  
- **Indirect (Mediation) Effect Testing**  
- **Total Effects**  
- **Significance Tests** (p-values, t-values, or bootstrapping depending on software)

## 📈 Expected Outputs

- Path coefficients for each variable  
- Significance of each path (direct/indirect)  
- Mediation effect results of time management  
- Interpretation of psychological factors contributing to academic procrastination  
- Final path diagram illustrating the relationships among variables
